## My NixOS configuration

You probably are here because I referred you to some particular bit to show you how to make something work.
If you are here on your own, maybe you can learn _something_ from my configs, but beware that that
_something_ certainly can't be "Nix good practices".

All code here is licensed under WTFPL license, except for code in `hosts/baraddur/m1-support/` folder,
which is adapted from incredibly awesome [nixos-m1](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-m1) project,
which original author licensed under totally non-meme MIT license for some reason.

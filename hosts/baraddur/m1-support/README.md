This is adapted from original (in quite barbaric ways)
to enable WIP GPU support.

If by any chance you stumble upon this:
PLEASE think twice before using this, there's a reason
Lina's driver isn't released yet. If you will still end
up using it - PLEASE don't go and complain to Asahi team
about your computer exploding or something, I don't want
to cause them problems. Don't complain to me either,
although you may ask questions.
